/**
 * Suggests what to add after the operator the user has selected.
 *
 * Finding the next step is a different question from finding an operator by
 * name, and the semantic search cannot answer it: embeddings measure how alike
 * two things are, so asking what follows `Sort` returns `Sort Partitions` and
 * `Stable Merge Sort` — the operators most like Sort, which are precisely the
 * ones nobody wants next. Sequence is not similarity.
 *
 * So the order comes from a table instead, keyed by the group an operator
 * belongs to. Twenty-six groups cover all 166 operators, the reasoning is
 * inspectable, and it cannot invent an operator that does not exist.
