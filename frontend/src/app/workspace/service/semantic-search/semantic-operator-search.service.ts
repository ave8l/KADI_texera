/**
 * Ranks operators by meaning rather than by name.
 *
 * The palette's keyword search only indexes `userFriendlyName`, so a query
 * phrased as an intent ("quitar duplicados") matches nothing even when an
 * operator's description says exactly that. This service compares the query
 * against a committed index of every operator's name, group and description.
 *
 * Everything runs in the browser: the operator vectors are generated offline
 * by `frontend/scripts/generate-operator-embeddings.mjs` and shipped as an
 * asset, and only the user's query is embedded at runtime. No backend call and
 * no API key are involved.
